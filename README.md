## Project Overview
This project builds a Sales Prediction Model using fictive data provided by Siemens. The model aims to predict future sales by analyzing historical sales data and incorporating external market data. The external data includes factors that could influence sales, such as events in the global market.

### Data Used
Sales Data: Historical sales data used to train and test the model.

External Market Data: Market data

### Objective
The goal of this project is to build a robust model that accurately forecasts sales based on past trends and external influences. By integrating both internal sales data and external factors, the model helps in understanding potential future sales outcomes.
